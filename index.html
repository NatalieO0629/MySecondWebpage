<h1>Welcome to Natalie's website</h1>    
<p class="intro">Hello and welcome to Natalie's website! This a place where you will learn a bit about me.</p>
<p>First off, I live in Canada and am a journalism student. This is my first time coding a webpage.</p>
<p>Secondly I want to introduce myself by listing off a few facts about myself. I love the cold weather, am a word-search enthusiast (medium to hard levels) and am a huge fan of The Golden Girls (Team Blanche). I also love scenery pictures, that is why I have posted a few of my favourite places below. Both photos were shot with my iPhone 7 Plus a few years ago.</p>

<h2>My Favourite websites:</h2>    
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/ontario/orleans"target="_blank">The Weather Network, Orleans</a></li>  
    <li><a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/"target="_blank">CTV News Ottawa</a></li>

  </ul>  
    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will make it sort of interactive by playing two truths one lie. This is a fun way to get to know more about me instead of myself just listing facts about me like previously above.</p>
    <p>Here are three statements about me that you have to guess which one is the lie.</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>I am above six feet tall.</li>
    <li>I taught myself how to knit during quarantine.</li>
    <li>I have never been to Europe.</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Answers to Q and A</h2>
    <p>Below I will list which answers were truths and which answer was the lie.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Truth: I am six foot one and a half.</li>
    <li>Lie: I taught myself how to skateboard during the quarantine. I do not know how to knit and am not interested.</li>
    <li>Truth: I have never been to Europe but am planning on it one day in the future.</li>
    </ul>
<img src="CapeCod.png" alt="A parking lot in Cape Cod with a pink sunset in the background.">   
    <figcaption>Cape Cod is one of my favourite places to vacation in the summer months. It is known for its shark infested beaches, pink skies and a few Chick-fil-A's (I suggest the waffle fries).</figcaption>
    <h2>See you next time</h2>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my sample webpage. I am looking forward to adding more and am still learning how to code so patience is key. I'd like to know a bit about you guys. Coming soon is a comment page where we can do Q and A's together! Take care.</p>
